# JÏ€'s Boilerplate { [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) }

Latetly this is my minimal settup to start a project.

It's loaded with my Typescript, Lintr, Prettier, Taildwind & Next 13 + some libraries with assets like heroicons.

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
